# In the Interest of Peaceful Relations

Now that you speak fluent Rabbit, you can look forward to long intellectual conversations on the meaning of carrots and the philosophical differences between timothy and alfalfa hay. Well, maybe not. But you just may enjoy being around rabbits more, and they’ll certainly be happier around you. You might even find yourself trying to binky. Just make sure not to speak Rabbit to humans who don’t speak it too. They will rarely understand, sometimes will run away, and may call the police. Wearing big rabbit ears will probably not help.

Final Note: I’ve added a page for behaviors that I think might be signals but am not sure about, and for communications that other folks have observed and that I’m still studying. If you’re interested in these potential future additions to this guide, feel free to read the “[Mysterious Rabbit Behaviors](./is-that-all-there-is.md "Is That All There Is?")” page.
