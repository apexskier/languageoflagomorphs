# Contributing

Please contribute to this project!

Contributions can be:

- Typo corrections
- Link fixes
- Site improvements

Please open a discussion to discuss major changes to content. I'm not sure yet if I'd like to significantly revise the content or imagery.

Content is written in [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) and the site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). If you've never edited content on GitHub, [here's a good introduction](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github).
