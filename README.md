# The Language of Lagomorphs

This repository exists to host the excellent ebook "The Language of Lagomorphs", Your Guide to Rabbit Communication, by Eric Mercer. This is a great guide to interpreting rabbit body language.

This used to be accessible at http://language.rabbitspeak.com/, but is no longer hosted there (the domain now points to something pretty sketchy) Though you can find it in the web archive and scraped as a PDF in a number of places, I wasn't able to find it hosted anywhere online directly and formatted as a proper website.

This is my attempt to revive and preserve the site, staying as true as possible to the original source.

## History

Here's my discoveries of the history of the original site.

- ????: Site moved to http://language.rabbitspeak.com/
- 2022-12-22: [Last web archive capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20221222220449/http://language.rabbitspeak.com/)
- 2023-01-22: [Forum post about the site being down](https://www.rabbitsonline.net/threads/language-of-lagomorphs-is-it-gone-forever.105436/)
